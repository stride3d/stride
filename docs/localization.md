# Localization

## Translation

Please help us translate by updating existing translations and/or adding new language at https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/xenko/

Translation are manually merged back from `weblate` branch to `master` branch.

## Activate new language in Game Studio

Once a new language has been added on weblate, it needs to be activated in the Game Studio during build & startup.

Please check commit https://github.com/xenko3d/xenko/commit/c70f07f449 for an example on how to add a new language in Game Studio.
