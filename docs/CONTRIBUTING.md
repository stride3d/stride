# Contributing to Stride

## Check our issue tracker

Please take a look at our [issue tracker](https://github.com/stride3d/stride/issues), especially issues marked with [help wanted](https://github.com/stride3d/stride/labels/help%20wanted).

If you are just getting started with Stride, issues marked with ['good first issue'](https://github.com/stride3d/stride/labels/good%20first%20issue) can be a good entry point.

## Notify users

Once you start working leave a message on the appropriate issue or create one if none exists to:
* make sure that no one else is working on that same issue
* lay out your plans and discuss it with collaborators and users to make sure it is properly architectured and would fit well in the project

## Coding style

Please use and follow Stride's `.editorconfig` when making changes to files.

## Submitting Changes

* Push your changes to a specific branch in your fork.
* Use that branch to create and fill out a pull request to the official repository.
* After creating that pull request and if it's your first time contributing a [CLA assistant](https://cla-assistant.io/) will ask you to sign the [Contributor License Agreement](https://github.com/stride3d/stride/blob/master/docs/ContributorLicenseAgreement.md).
