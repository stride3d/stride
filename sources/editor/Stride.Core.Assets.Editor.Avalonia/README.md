# Stride.Core.Assets.Editor.Avalonia

This project contains the base views and templates of the editors.

## Dependencies

* It is a specific implementation using Avalonia.
* It will likely only reference `Stride.Core.Assets.Editor`, as well as Avalonia-specific libraries.

## Implementations

Templates for the property grid are here.

## Notes

* The goal is to be able to share that library with any application that wants to work with Stride core assets.
* It can theoretically be used for another engine that would only be based on the core assets and libraries. So it has no dependency on the Stride runtime.
