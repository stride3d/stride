    /// <remarks>
    /// During texture sampling, one or more texels are read and combined (this is calling filtering) to produce a single value. Point sampling reads a single texel while linear sampling reads two texels (endpoints) and linearly interpolates a third value between the endpoints. HLSL texture-sampling functions also support comparison filtering during texture sampling. Comparison filtering compares each sampled texel against a comparison value. The boolean result is blended the same way that normal texture filtering is blended. You can use HLSL intrinsic texture-sampling functions that implement texture filtering only or companion functions that use texture filtering with comparison filtering.  Texture Sampling FunctionTexture Sampling Function with Comparison Filtering samplesamplecmp or samplecmplevelzero  ? Comparison filters only work with textures that have the following DXGI formats: R32_FLOAT_X8X24_TYPELESS, R32_FLOAT, R24_UNORM_X8_TYPELESS, R16_UNORM.
