That is, the values for <strong>left</strong>, <strong>top</strong>, and <strong>front</strong> are included in the box region while the values for right, bottom, and back are excluded from the box region. For example, for a box that is one pixel wide, (right - left) == 1; the box region includes the left pixel but not the right pixel.</p>
