# Stride.Core.Presentation.Avalonia

This project contains helpers for views.

## Depencencies

* It can only references *Core* libraries.
* It is a specific implementation using Avalonia.
* It will likely only reference `Stride.Core.Presentation`.

## Implementations

Value converters, markup extensions and custom controls are here.

## Notes

* The goal is to be able to share that library with any application that wants to work with Stride core.
* It can theoretically be used for another engine that would only be based on the core libraries.
  So it has no dependency on the Stride runtime.
