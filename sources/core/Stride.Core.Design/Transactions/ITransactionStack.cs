    /// <remarks>
    /// A transaction stack is a stack with a predefined <see cref="Capacity"/>. Transactions that are completed
    /// are added to the top of the stack.
    /// When the stack is full, any new transaction that is added will discard the transaction at the bottom of the stack
    /// (which is the oldest transaction still in the stack) in order to create a slot to add itself on the top.
    /// Transaction can be rollbacked to restore previous states, and also rollforwarded again. Rollbacked transactions
    /// remain on the stack, but if a new transaction is added, they will be discarded (purged) from the stack and the
    /// new transaction will be added on the top of last non-rollbacked transaction.
    /// Any transaction that is discarded will be frozen, a mechanism that allows to release references to related object
    /// and allow garbage collecting them. Freezing is similar to disposing but is a different interface since the
    /// <see cref="IDisposable"/> interface is used to complete transactions in order to make then compatible with the
    /// <c>using</c> statement.
