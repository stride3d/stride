# Stride.Core.Presentation

This project is the base project for the view models in an application that uses the MVVM pattern.

## Dependencies

* It can only references *Core* libraries.
* It should be platform-agnostic as well as UI-agnostic.
  In other words, no dependencies on platform (e.g. Windows), or UI library (e.g. Avalonia, WPF) are allowed.
* It will likely only reference `Stride.Core.Design`.

## Implementations

`ViewModelBase` is here as well as interfaces for services (but usually not their implementation).

## Notes

* The goal is to be able to share that library with any application that wants to work with Stride core.
* It can theoretically be used for another engine that would only be based on the core libraries.
  So it has no dependency on the Stride runtime.
